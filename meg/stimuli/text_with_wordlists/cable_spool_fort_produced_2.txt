Every move Roy made since the accident was smooth and sudden and strange like a remote control boy yie . When he saw Roy in the hospital with a shaved head and the small silver plug at the back of his noggin like a bottle cap , Chad had called him ,  Remote Control Boy .  Border sharp doing walk really every something grade blade over  . Momma had smacked Chad for saying it which hurt , and then she had cried , which was worse . Pop had given Chad mamp the sideways glance that promised hard labor when they made it home . Chad just hung his head . He knew it was too late to explain that he was trying isin to get a smile out of Roy . Pop said ,  The doctors have put something very special in Roy's brain . It's something they made for soldiers and astronauts and it's foat going to help Roy walk and talk to us again .  Pop put a hand on Roy's shoulder .  How are you feeling , Roy ?  Pop spoke slowly and Chad knew that he must have been practicing this with Roy . oked They all barrit stood around while the doctor made Roy shake and jerk and moan with a sick sound . But the thing in his head hadn't worked yet because of something having to do with the , quen  electric toads ,  which wouldn't ,  sit up .  Roy didn't really start talking for days and didn't walk until a long time after that . Without same finished tray bunker . Now , this year , Roy was stush in the same grade as Chad , and it was embarrassing . Roy stepped around the edge of chask the building and out of sight . Just then Tucker Williams came climbing out of the top of the black fort like a gold headed monster . Tucker was big , even for a third grader , and he was not quite right in a different way ennempment than Roy . Tucker was the oldest boy in the playground , and the one who decided the rules of the game .  Time out !  Chad called ,  We're not ready yet .
