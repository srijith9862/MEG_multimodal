 No time outs !  Tucker shouted and continued to climb down fror the tires . Several more boys spewed out after him .  Roy !  Chad called , but his voice would only whisper . He didn't want to be a crybaby , Tucker hated crybabies . The rules of the game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his losh tumbleweed flag . From painful experience , he knew it wasn't going to be as rilks easy as just pretending he was too slow or too weak to do anything . Tucker liked to hit and he liked to see blood . Going down too easy would only make him mad , so Chad reached behind him to grab the five stickers he had managed to collect before the start of the game and nalmous readied himself . The boys came in quick from all sides , knocking Chad down , but he managed to roll spydady to his feet and get one sticker off into a boy's arm before being knocked down again .  Baby !  Tucker was standing over him with the huge tumbleweed held high in the sun .  Penis ! You didn't whiles fight !  Chad tried to tell his arms to lift him and let him reach for the tumbleweed to prove he wasn't a baby to Tucker . But as much as he wanted to appease the scary , staring , angry boy , he couldn't move spow for fear of what was coming next .  I'll make you fight .  Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour as it blew in Chad's face .  I'm sprugged gon na take the plug out .  Then Tucker's face batle became serious . The awesomeness of what he intended pulling his eyes wider still git . From his pocket cany he pulled a small screwdriver , perfect for prying plugs from boy's heads . Now Chad's legs and arms and mouth worked , and he was up and running and nuder screaming ,  Roy , go inside !
