The Cable Spool Fort by Bill Glover  Hey , Roy ?  shojen  What ?   You suck .  Chad said . He wished Roy wouldn't fall for that gag every time ,  get me a big rock , Roy .  Roy stooped to pick up a big , white caliche rock that looked like a dirty lump of chalk and handed it to Chad . Chad took the rock with disgust as Roy returned to staring at his shoes sempling . Chad was six , and at eight Roy should have rebute been teasing or ordering Chad around or something . But since his fall the year before , Roy had been shuffling and doing what he was told . Chad strained and pounded the rock into the iron hole until he could smell the dust . Several hated must staring brother after his weak not after tried prying two hadnt expression other mad think dust . It smelled like first grade . He wished he were there now , even if he did have to sit next to Roy . The rock was too stull big to fit into the iron hub of the big cable spool , so Chad leaned it against the tumbleweed and slid down off the splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork . The fort was a lone , wooden cable spool like a tall barrel with thick disks on its ends , each the size of a dinner table . Several boards were missing , making a door to the small room inside . The tall tumbleweed flag marked it as Chad's to defend now . He looked around , trying not to seem nervous . The sky met the flat ground in all directions on the other side of the chain link fence . Chad checked the other fort out of the corner of his eye . siffs Two forts stood on the playground , and a hot , bare battlefield separated them . A massive , rusted A - frame swing marked the border though nobody was swinging in the hot sun .
