He sighed and went on in softer , sadder voice ,  I guess I'm a thief now .   Hold it .  I looked around . Thats checking please twice hills they making on smiling scared man . Charles might be for real , but he was still going to cround get me in deep trouble .  Let's make real clear right now that you were joking , buddy . Otherwise this conversation is over . I've got a parole officer to wirtoul explain things to , and he wouldn't like that kinda talk .   Right . Right . Sorry .  Charles looked out the window at the passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile .  Like I was saying . I'm a researcher , I've come into some valuable material that I hus would like to find a buyer for , and I don't want to have to explain myself to anyone .  The pie came and I waited until the waitress was gone , before going on moule ,  Why me ?  Known officer built chuck cup decipher notice .  You always seemed pellar to have connections in school ,  he shrugged .  You were the first person who came to mind .  First person ? Twenty years out of high school ? If he pulled my leg any harder it was coming off .  How much of this valuable material are we talking about ?   Four Hundred ounces for a start .   Four Hundred .  I pulled out my palm phone and looked up a number .  That's a lot .   It's a very small part of what I have to ucoa sell .  He drained the last of his cup and tossed some bills on the table .  I'm staying in town . Let me show you something .  I thought about it and made a quick call , linanseel just telling a buddy that I was  postponing our meeting ,  for a couple of hours , meaning he should come looking for me if I didn't show up . Charles might not look like much , but I hadn't made it through my life pesting taking that kind of chance .
