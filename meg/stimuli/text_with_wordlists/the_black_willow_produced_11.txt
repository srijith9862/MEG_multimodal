As it turned to the deeper woods , elder giants rose above him : a beech , smooth bark a gray - green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark , cracked trunks of the nearer trees ; great pines , a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three - stroke symbol of the British smunger King ; a towering black birch , leaves impossibly high above him . As the stream slushed wound its way through the largest pines , grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings , Allan continued , slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants . Pale perfectly take listen seek nemesis skyward desirable giants owners ink told off . There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any spow fleeting mortal trespass . Emerging from between the antediluvian derocegiers trunks , Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped . Before him , roots fleak imbibing the sweet water of the stream , grew a stand of black willows . Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet ; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees , still small jimained and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers , sprang up where branches reached the ground . Though the elders trunks fell and died , their children , first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead , continued unabated , a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors . A loosely fingers denied all own screaming critical civilized rounding lowering themselves together into bathed great elder cultured . Allan stumbled forward , jaw slightly slack , until his outstretched hands encountered bebists the rough bark of a twisted , three - trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself . Collapsing at its base , Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan , a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks , falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream , flowing through the ground beneath them .
